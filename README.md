#Hello

This is a simple phpBB 3.1 extension that lets you add a greeting to the username in the header navigation bar.

Turn this:

![before hello](http://i.imgur.com/gPeee4F.png "before hello")

Into this:

![after hello](http://i.imgur.com/KVEUF71.png "after hello")

Note that this only works for Prosilver. subSilver2 does not have the username in the navigation bar and therefore does not have the events.

If there is interest, future versions may contain the following:
- Customizable via the ACP
- Different greeting based on user's board language (Hello, Hola, Anyeong, etc.)
- Different greeting based on current time (good morning, good afternoon, good evening, etc.)
- Different greeting based on day of the week (Happy Monday!, TGIF!, etc.)
- Different greeting based on specific date (e.g. Happy New Years!, Merry Christmas!, Happy Hanukkah!, etc.)
- Rotating messages (i.e. have it randomly pick between a set of messages, like Hello, Hi, 'Sup, etc.)
- More?
